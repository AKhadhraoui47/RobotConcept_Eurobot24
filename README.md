### Mechanical Design Overview

The design was developed entirely from scratch, considering available materials, budget, and the dimensional constraints specified in the Eurobot 2024 Competition rulebook.

### Key Features

#### Easy Maintenance

The robot's segmented, removable carcass allows for easy maintenance and modifications without the need for complete disassembly.

#### Precision Engineering
Every component, down to the finest detail, including dimensions and mounting solutions, was meticulously planned and executed.

#### Solid Assembly
Built on a robust skeleton of profile bars, the structure offers both easy disassembly and a strong, reliable foundation.

#### Independent Levels
For convenience, the control system was organized on a separate, independent floor, simplifying installation and management.
